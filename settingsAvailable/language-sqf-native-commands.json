Try nearTargets to see what else is considered a target.

As soon as missile is fired, cursorTarget switches to current known target under cursor or objNull. Targeting (currently \"T\" in Arma 3) works regardless of the state of \"auto-spotting\".\nAdding a target to the known list could be done with reveal command. When auto-spotting is enabled, zooming on the enemy target with cross-hairs usually reveals the target.

This is of course a bit of a trick, because rather than a true optimization, it disables part of the simulation. However, there are certainly types of scenarios where these raycasts are not needed. An example is a fully Player-versus-Player scenario, where the visibility between every combination of player entity is not needed. So why not disable this by default? There are cases where you do require these raycasts, for example in stealth scenarios. Without them, commands like knowsAbout, nearTargets and targetKnowledge will only function for local units! The commands themselves are local, can be used on servers and clients, and the state is reset when the scenario ends. So, carefully consider whether your scenario can benefit from this method.",

There is limited error reporting about format errors as the command expects well formatted array as argument.
